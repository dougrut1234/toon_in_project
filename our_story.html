		<p id="story_first_paragraph">It all started one spring semester at Montclair State University, where I was studying to become a paralegal. It was at my very first class, law and litigation, taught by the wonderful Blaise Apoldite, which would inspire me to write my first book. Professor Apoldiate would use hilarious examples relating to personal injury law, real life examples that would never fail to get a laugh from his students, especially from me. The scenarios Professor Apoldite used were so effective that I even got an A in his class, as did everyone else of course. I wanted to use his teachings that would not only help aspiring law students but would also help young people who are interested in law and teach them the many rules and law which would follow them in the real world.</p> 
		<p id="story_second_paragraph">After compiling my old notes for my book and hiring an enthusiastic illustrator from Boston, I  approached another professor at Montclair State, Professor Peter King, who was more than happy to meet with me every week to perfect the book, content wise and marketing wise. After seven months of revising and editing with Professor King, the book was complete and we uploaded to Amazon!</p>

		<p id="story_third_paragraph">I am very proud of what we have created. We feel this would push young people and anyone interested in the rule of law. We hope business law, entertainment law, nursing school would follow sooner or later.</p>
