<p id="about_us"><b>Rules. Rules. Laws.</b> We can’t live in a functional society without them and explaining them to the young ones can be seen as quite the chore. Getting them to actually a listen is a challenge and getting them to actually learn and follow…well there’s still no guarantee. How could you get them to enjoy learning when it isn’t fun? Our Toon In books will change all that. Fun for all ages, including grown-ups, our books will help anyone grasp simple rules and laws that we must follow throughout our everyday lives. Told with colorful characters and popping illustrations, our books will make it not only fun but most importantly easy to remember starting with our first book: <b>Legal Toons: Negligence Law!</b></p>
